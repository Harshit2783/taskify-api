/*
Note: Now here(authController.js + authRoutes.js) we are only doing user authentication so this should be clarified.

One-line summary(Read the details below):-

Authentication = verifying identity
JWT = remembering that verification across requests

They are related, but not the same thing.

1️⃣ What does authentication ACTUALLY mean?

Authentication = proving who you are

That’s it. Nothing more.
Examples: “I am Alice → here is my password”

If the system can verify your identity, authentication is done.

👉 Authentication does NOT mean protection
👉 Authentication does NOT mean permissions
👉 Authentication does NOT mean access control

Those are different concepts.

2️⃣ What we implemented here
we did two things:

✅ Register
Store identity info (email + password)

✅ Login
Check:
- Does this user exist?
- Is the password correct?
If yes → identity is verified.

🎯 That is 100% authentication

Even though:
- No JWT
- No protected routes
- No sessions

Authentication already happened.

3️⃣ Then why does it feel incomplete?

Because of this missing question:
“Okay… but how does the server remember that I’m authenticated after login?”

Right now:
- You log in
- Server says “Login successful”
- Next request → server forgets you completely

So authentication is stateless and temporary.

That’s where JWT (or sessions or another mechanism) come in.

After login, the server must answer: “How do I recognize this user again on the next request?”

Possible answers:
- Cookies + sessions
- JWT
- OAuth tokens
- API keys

So JWT is just one memory mechanism.

Imp. Clarification:
JWT does NOT authenticate by itself
JWT just remembers the result of authentication.

We are writing all this cuz' we are gonna use JWT in our project.

4️⃣ Very important separation (engineers get this wrong)

Concept	                    What it means

Authentication	    -        Who are you?
Authorization	    -        What are you allowed to do?
Protection	        -        Blocking access to routes

Right now:
We have authentication

We do NOT have:
- Authorization
- Route protection
- Ownership checks

Those come later.

5️⃣ 👉 Why does the server forget the user after login in your current implementation?

The server forgets the user after login because HTTP is stateless(This means every request made by client is independent of other 
requests) and the client does not send any identity proof (like a token or session id) with subsequent requests, so the server 
has no way to recognize the user again.

After login, we are not giving the client anything like:

- a token
- a session ID
- a cookie
- any identifier at all

So next time the client makes a request:
GET /api/tasks

The server sees:
“Who are you? I have no idea.”

How JWT fixes exactly this (one line preview)
JWT solves this by:

- Giving the client a token after login
- The client sends this token on every request
- The server verifies it and knows who the user is

No memory needed on the server.

// Now After authentication we proceeded to JWT(to understand it, read JWT.pdf but first read the above collapsed comments).

/* Now there was a previous version of this authController.js file also in which we only did authentication and we added jwt
token generaton later in this updated version of authController.js. Although we haven't made much changes from the previous 
version to this version but you can see changes made in this file on GITHUB IN THE 9TH COMMIT MADE ON 31TH DEC 2025 NAMED 
"Implemented JWT Creation". */
